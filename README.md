## Missing Values

Missing data, or missing values, occur when __no data__ / __no value__ is stored for certain observations within a variable. 

### Why is data missing?

The reason of missing data can be very different. like:

- A value is missing because it was forgotten, lost or not stored properly
- For a certain observation, the value does not exist
- The value can't be known or identified


### Missing Data Mechanisms

There are 3 mechanisms that lead to missing data, 2 of them involve missing data randomly or almost-randomly, and the third one involves a systematic loss of data.

#### Missing at Random, MAR: 
#### Missing Not at Random, MNAR: 


what i have done in this notebook is:

detect and quantify missing values
use the 3 different mechanisms of missing data introduction


Note: 2 different datasets are used in this notebook.
make sure they are downloaded
